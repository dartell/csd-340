    <h1>Assignment 2.3 - Building a Web Page Exercise - Part 2</h1>
    <h2> Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
    <p class = "intro">I'm from all over, but consider Fort Walton Beach, FL my home.  It is a sunny place near multiple military bases.  The beach is always around 15 minutes away.  FWB is between Pensacola and Destin.</p>
    <p>I grew up as a military brat.  That means my dad was in the military in which we moved all over. <span> I was born on a military base in Nuremberg Germany. </span>  When I was born, the hospital staff put me in a Christmas stocking because I was born near Christmas</p>
    <p>My hobbies include playing video games, running, hanging with friends, and Carolina Panthers football.  I've been a Carolina fan since the team entered the NFL in 1995.  Running allows me to blow off steam from a long work day.  My favorite video games are fighting games like Street Fighter.</p>
    <p>Most of my family resides in the southern states.  I have aunts, uncles, and cousins in North Carolina and Georgia.  On my dad's side, I have some family in New York City.  Currently my brother lives in Ohio and my parents in Hawaii.</p>
