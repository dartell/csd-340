    <p>They came from below. Robotic rocks capable of speech. We called them <span id="Rock-Robos">_________</span>.
        First they played the role of tourist attractions, they moved slow and didn't bother anyone. That is until the
        <span id="Granite-Gib">"________"</span> attack.
    </p>
    <p>It happened slowly at first. They would climb onto each other forming small structures. Sometimes they resemble
        houses, other times famous presidents faces. But on August 29, 2077, they formed a gigantic
        <span id="star">________</span>. A
        structure so big that it reached the clouds!

    </p>
    <p>That's when our rock solid society fell apart. The gigantic structure tumbled over killing countless people. The
        <span id="Rock-n-Roll">_______</span> wars had begun.
